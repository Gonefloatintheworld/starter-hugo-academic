title: Semantic SLAM towards Outdoor Dynamic Environment  
summary: 路 Used ORB-SLAM2 as the framework, run the algorithm under Ubuntu 18.04 and verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with KITTI dataset and ZED2 self-collection dataset. 路  Embedded the Deeplabv3+ semantic segmentation model into the stereo model of ORB-SLAM2 to guarantee recognition of dynamic objects. 路  Determined the dynamic hierarchy of objects in the scene based on the prior knowledge. 路  Proposed a dynamic model to judge the motion status of objects by comparing the pixel displacement. Designed a feature selection strategy to discard the feature points of dynamic regions.
